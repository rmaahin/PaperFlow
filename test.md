# Introduction

Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [@hochreiter1997] and
gated recurrent [@gruEval14] neural networks in particular, have been
firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling
and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine
translation [@sutskever14; @bahdanau2014neural; @cho2014learning].
Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of
recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures
[@wu2016google; @luong2015effective; @jozefowicz2016exploring].

Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions
of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in
computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states $h_t$, as a
function of the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ and the input for
position $t$. This inherently sequential nature precludes
parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at
longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across
examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in
computational efficiency through factorization tricks
[@Kuchaiev2017Factorization] and conditional computation
[@shazeer2017outrageously], while also improving model performance in
case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential
computation, however, remains.

Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence
modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of
dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output
sequences [@bahdanau2014neural; @structuredAttentionNetworks]. In all
but a few cases [@decomposableAttnModel], however, such attention
mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.

In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing
recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to
draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer
allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state
of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as
twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

# Background

The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of
the Extended Neural GPU [@extendedngpu], ByteNet [@NalBytenet2017] and
ConvS2S [@JonasFaceNet2017], all of which use convolutional neural
networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in
parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number
of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or
output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for
ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to
learn dependencies between distant positions [@hochreiter2001gradient].
In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations,
albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging
attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head
Attention as described in
section [3.2](#sec:attention){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:attention"}.

Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention
mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to
compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used
successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension,
abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning
task-independent sentence representations
[@cheng2016long; @decomposableAttnModel; @paulus2017deep; @lin2017structured].

End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism
instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform
well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks
[@sukhbaatar2015].

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first
transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute
representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned
RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the
Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over
models such as [@neural_gpu; @NalBytenet2017] and [@JonasFaceNet2017].

# Model Architecture

![The Transformer - model
architecture.](Figures/ModalNet-21.png){#fig:model-arch}

Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an
encoder-decoder structure
[@cho2014learning; @bahdanau2014neural; @sutskever14]. Here, the encoder
maps an input sequence of symbol representations $(x_1, ..., x_n)$ to a
sequence of continuous representations $\mathbf{z} = (z_1, ..., z_n)$.
Given $\mathbf{z}$, the decoder then generates an output sequence
$(y_1,...,y_m)$ of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model
is auto-regressive [@graves2013generating], consuming the previously
generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked
self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the
encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of
Figure [1](#fig:model-arch){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:model-arch"}, respectively.

## Encoder and Decoder Stacks

#### Encoder:

The encoder is composed of a stack of $N=6$ identical layers. Each layer
has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism,
and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward
network. We employ a residual connection [@he2016deep] around each of
the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [@layernorm2016].
That is, the output of each sub-layer is
$\mathrm{LayerNorm}(x + \mathrm{Sublayer}(x))$, where
$\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)$ is the function implemented by the sub-layer
itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the
model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension
$d_{\text{model}}=512$.

#### Decoder:

The decoder is also composed of a stack of $N=6$ identical layers. In
addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder
inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the
output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual
connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer
normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the
decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent
positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings
are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position
$i$ can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than $i$.

## Attention {#sec:attention}

An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of
key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output
are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values,
where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility
function of the query with the corresponding key.

### Scaled Dot-Product Attention {#sec:scaled-dot-prod}

We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\"
(Figure [2](#fig:multi-head-att){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:multi-head-att"}). The input consists of queries and keys
of dimension $d_k$, and values of dimension $d_v$. We compute the dot
products of the query with all keys, divide each by $\sqrt{d_k}$, and
apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.

In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries
simultaneously, packed together into a matrix $Q$. The keys and values
are also packed together into matrices $K$ and $V$. We compute the
matrix of outputs as:

$$\begin{equation}
   \mathrm{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \mathrm{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V
\end{equation}$$

The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention
[@bahdanau2014neural], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention.
Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the
scaling factor of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$. Additive attention computes
the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single
hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity,
dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in
practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix
multiplication code.

While for small values of $d_k$ the two mechanisms perform similarly,
additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for
larger values of $d_k$ [@DBLP:journals/corr/BritzGLL17]. We suspect that
for large values of $d_k$, the dot products grow large in magnitude,
pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small
gradients [^4]. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$.

### Multi-Head Attention {#sec:multihead}

<figcaption>(left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head
Attention consists of several attention layers running in
parallel.</figcaption>
</figure>

Instead of performing a single attention function with
$d_{\text{model}}$-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it
beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values $h$ times
with different, learned linear projections to $d_k$, $d_k$ and $d_v$
dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of
queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in
parallel, yielding $d_v$-dimensional output values. These are
concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as
depicted in Figure [2](#fig:multi-head-att){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:multi-head-att"}.

Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information
from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a
single attention head, averaging inhibits this.

$$\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) &= \mathrm{Concat}(\mathrm{head_1}, ..., \mathrm{head_h})W^O\\
%    \mathrm{where} \mathrm{head_i} &= \mathrm{Attention}(QW_Q_i^{\dmodel \times d_q}, KW_K_i^{\dmodel \times d_k}, VW^V_i^{\dmodel \times d_v})\\
    \text{where}~\mathrm{head_i} &= \mathrm{Attention}(QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i)\\
\end{align*}$$

Where the projections are parameter matrices
$W^Q_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}\times d_k}$,
$W^K_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}\times d_k}$,
$W^V_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}\times d_v}$ and
$W^O \in \mathbb{R}^{hd_v \times d_{\text{model}}}$.

In this work we employ $h=8$ parallel attention layers, or heads. For
each of these we use $d_k=d_v=d_{\text{model}}/h=64$. Due to the reduced
dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that
of single-head attention with full dimensionality.

### Applications of Attention in our Model

The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:

- In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the
  previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the
  output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to
  attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the
  typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence
  models such as
  [@wu2016google; @bahdanau2014neural; @JonasFaceNet2017].

- The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer
  all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this
  case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position
  in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of
  the encoder.

- Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in
  the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and
  including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow
  in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement
  this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to
  $-\infty$) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to
  illegal connections. See
  Figure [2](#fig:multi-head-att){reference-type="ref"
  reference="fig:multi-head-att"}.

## Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks {#sec:ffn}

In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder
and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is
applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of
two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

$$\begin{equation}
   \mathrm{FFN}(x)=\max(0, xW_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2
\end{equation}$$

While the linear transformations are the same across different
positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another
way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The
dimensionality of input and output is $d_{\text{model}}=512$, and the
inner-layer has dimensionality $d_{ff}=2048$.

## Embeddings and Softmax

Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned
embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of
dimension $d_{\text{model}}$. We also use the usual learned linear
transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to
predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same
weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax
linear transformation, similar to [@press2016using]. In the embedding
layers, we multiply those weights by $\sqrt{d_{\text{model}}}$.

## Positional Encoding

Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for
the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some
information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the
sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input
embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The
positional encodings have the same dimension $d_{\text{model}}$ as the
embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of
positional encodings, learned and fixed [@JonasFaceNet2017].

In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:

$$\begin{align*}
    PE_{(pos,2i)} = sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}}) \\
    PE_{(pos,2i+1)} = cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}})
\end{align*}$$

where $pos$ is the position and $i$ is the dimension. That is, each
dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The
wavelengths form a geometric progression from $2\pi$ to
$10000 \cdot 2\pi$. We chose this function because we hypothesized it
would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions,
since for any fixed offset $k$, $PE_{pos+k}$ can be represented as a
linear function of $PE_{pos}$.

We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings
[@JonasFaceNet2017] instead, and found that the two versions produced
nearly identical results (see
Table [3](#tab:variations){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:variations"} row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version
because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer
than the ones encountered during training.

# Why Self-Attention

In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to
the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one
variable-length sequence of symbol representations $(x_1, ..., x_n)$ to
another sequence of equal length $(z_1, ..., z_n)$, with
$x_i, z_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$, such as a hidden layer in a typical
sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of
self-attention we consider three desiderata.

One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the
amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the
minimum number of sequential operations required.

The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the
network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many
sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to
learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward
signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between
any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the
easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [@hochreiter2001gradient].
Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and
output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.

  convolutions and $r$ the size of the neighborhood in restricted
  self-attention.
:::
::::

As noted in Table [1](#tab:op_complexities){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:op_complexities"}, a self-attention layer connects all
positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations,
whereas a recurrent layer requires $O(n)$ sequential operations. In
terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than
recurrent layers when the sequence length $n$ is smaller than the
representation dimensionality $d$, which is most often the case with
sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine
translations, such as word-piece [@wu2016google] and byte-pair
[@sennrich2015neural] representations. To improve computational
performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention
could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size $r$ in
the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This
would increase the maximum path length to $O(n/r)$. We plan to
investigate this approach further in future work.

A single convolutional layer with kernel width $k < n$ does not connect
all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of
$O(n/k)$ convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or
$O(log_k(n))$ in the case of dilated convolutions [@NalBytenet2017],
increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in
the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than
recurrent layers, by a factor of $k$. Separable convolutions
[@xception2016], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to
$O(k \cdot n \cdot d + n \cdot d^2)$. Even with $k=n$, however, the
complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a
self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach
we take in our model.

As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.
We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and
discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads
clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit
behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the
sentences.

# Training

This section describes the training regime for our models.

## Training Data and Batching

We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of
about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair
encoding [@DBLP:journals/corr/BritzGLL17], which has a shared
source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we
used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting
of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary
[@wu2016google]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate
sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs
containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.

## Hardware and Schedule

We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our
base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper,
each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models
for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described
on the bottom line of table [3](#tab:variations){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:variations"}), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models
were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).

## Optimizer

We used the Adam optimizer [@kingma2014adam] with $\beta_1=0.9$,
$\beta_2=0.98$ and $\epsilon=10^{-9}$. We varied the learning rate over
the course of training, according to the formula:

$$\begin{equation}
lrate = d_{\text{model}}^{-0.5} \cdot
  \min({step\_num}^{-0.5},
    {step\_num} \cdot {warmup\_steps}^{-1.5})
\end{equation}$$

This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first
$warmup\_steps$ training steps, and decreasing it thereafter
proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used
$warmup\_steps=4000$.

## Regularization {#sec:reg}

We employ three types of regularization during training:

#### Residual Dropout

We apply dropout [@srivastava2014dropout] to the output of each
sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In
addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the
positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the
base model, we use a rate of $P_{drop}=0.1$.

#### Label Smoothing

During training, we employed label smoothing of value
$\epsilon_{ls}=0.1$ [@DBLP:journals/corr/SzegedyVISW15]. This hurts
perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy
and BLEU score.

: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous

On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer
model (Transformer (big) in
Table [2](#tab:wmt-results){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:wmt-results"}) outperforms the best previously reported
models (including ensembles) by more than $2.0$ BLEU, establishing a new
state-of-the-art BLEU score of $28.4$. The configuration of this model
is listed in the bottom line of
Table [3](#tab:variations){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:variations"}. Training took $3.5$ days on $8$ P100 GPUs.
Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and
ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive
models.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model
achieves a BLEU score of $41.0$, outperforming all of the previously
published single models, at less than $1/4$ the training cost of the
previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for
English-to-French used dropout rate $P_{drop}=0.1$, instead of $0.3$.

For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the
last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the
big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search
with a beam size of $4$ and length penalty $\alpha=0.6$ [@wu2016google].
These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the
development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to
input length + $50$, but terminate early when possible [@wu2016google].

Table [2](#tab:wmt-results){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:wmt-results"} summarizes our results and compares our
translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from
the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used
to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs

: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are
identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the
English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed
perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and
should not be compared to per-word perplexities.
:::
::::

To evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer,
we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in
performance on English-to-German translation on the development set,
newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section,
but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in
Table [3](#tab:variations){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:variations"}.

In Table [3](#tab:variations){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:variations"} rows (A), we vary the number of attention
heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of
computation constant, as described in Section
[3.2.2](#sec:multihead){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:multihead"}.
While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting,
quality also drops off with too many heads.

In Table [3](#tab:variations){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:variations"} rows (B), we observe that reducing the
attention key size $d_k$ hurts model quality. This suggests that
determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated
compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further
observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better,
and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we
replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional
embeddings [@JonasFaceNet2017], and observe nearly identical results to
the base model.

  : The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing
  (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)
:::
::::

To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we
performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task
presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural
constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN
sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain
state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [@KVparse15].

We trained a 4-layer transformer with $d_{model} = 1024$ on the Wall
Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [@marcus1993building],
about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised
setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from
with approximately 17M sentences [@KVparse15]. We used a vocabulary of
16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for
the semi-supervised setting.

We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout,
both attention and residual
(section [5.4](#sec:reg){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:reg"}),
learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all
other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base
translation model. During inference, we increased the maximum output
length to input length + $300$. We used a beam size of $21$ and
$\alpha=0.3$ for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.

Our results in Table [4](#tab:parsing-results){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:parsing-results"} show that despite the lack of
task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding
better results than all previously reported models with the exception of
the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [@dyer-rnng:16].

In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [@KVparse15], the
Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser [@petrov-EtAl:2006:ACL] even
when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.

# Conclusion

In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence
transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent
layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with
multi-headed self-attention.

For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly
faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On
both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French
translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task
our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.

We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to
apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems
involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate
local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large
inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation
less sequential is another research goals of ours.

The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at

word.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Many of the attention heads exhibit behaviour that seems
related to the structure of the sentence. We give two such examples
above, from two different heads from the encoder self-attention at layer
5 of 6. The heads clearly learned to perform different
tasks.</figcaption>

[^1]: Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed
    replacing RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to
    evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the
    first Transformer models and has been crucially involved in every
    aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention,
    multi-head attention and the parameter-free position representation
    and became the other person involved in nearly every detail. Niki
    designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants
    in our original codebase and tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented
    with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase,
    and efficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent
    countless long days designing various parts of and implementing
    tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving
    results and massively accelerating our research.

[^4]: To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the
    components of $q$ and $k$ are independent random variables with mean
    $0$ and variance $1$. Then their dot product,
    $q \cdot k = \sum_{i=1}^{d_k} q_ik_i$, has mean $0$ and variance
    $d_k$.

[^5]: We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40
    and P100, respectively.
